
<-------------> PRICE HISTORY APP <------------->

---> OVERVIEW:
===============================================================================
The purpose of this project is to build a simple desktop app that will allow
the user to search the price history data for any company they want using
the TD Ameritrade API. Any of the code in here that I write is probably not
that good. I am a beginner trying to learn the process of writing
scripts and using git and GitHub. Any help or pointers would be appreciated.
===============================================================================
===============================================================================
---> APP GOAL:
(I want to make a few versions, each version being a finished "App" by itself.
I'm hoping as I learn to complete a version, I will get better and be able to
create the next. So far I have the first two version "Goals" typed out and
will add to this later on.)
===============================================================================
---> VERSION 1:

* Ask user for the company name & symbol that they want data for;

* Then have a GUI window pop up with all the possible params
      (1-Day, 2-Day, 1-Minute, 2-Minute, etc..)

* Once user selects all the params, pass that information to the
  fetch_price_history() func

* Then take the returned data and use pandas to re shape the data into a
| pandas df to be printed out.
|
---> Also, at the same time I want the re-shaped data to be stored in a SQLite
|    database. All tables will be created based off the company symbol, and
|    the price history params chosen. (EXAMPLE: PH_MSFT_1min)
|
---> If the table already exists, the data will be added instead of creating
     a new table.

* Once the data is re-shaped and saved to a SQLite database I want a message
|  to pop up saying -->
|  {company name}'s {frequency + frequencyType } Data Saved to {DB name}!
|  Example: Microsoft's 1minute Data Saved to Main Database!
---> include a button in the window that says 'Ok'

* Finally, once the 'OK' button is clicked, a new GUI window will pop up
  asking the user if they want to search for any other price history data
===============================================================================
---> VERSION 2: (This version will add on to the GUI)

* create a window where all the information (params) are input at the same time
  with a button that says "SUBMIT" to send the GET request

* Have the reshaped data (pandas DF) show up in the GUI's window with
  the same success message from version 1

* Also include an option to view all the tables in the SQLite database that
  is being used to store the returned data

* Make it possible to view all the data in a selected table inside the GUI
  window.
